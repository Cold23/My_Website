      <h2>üìú About me</h2>
      <p>
        Currently Studying Applied Mathematics at the National Technical University of Athens. In my free time I like to
        experiment
        with new ideas on Game Development or Web Development (Like this website), catch up on new frameworks and new
        techniques.
        Other than that I enjoy exercising, like lifting weights or running, and lastly I invest some of my income in
        Securities.
      </p>

      <p>
        After my Bachelor's degree I would like to look into how Machine Learning can be used to improve Game's
        Development
        and how it can be leveraged in a Developer's workflow.
      </p>

          on it.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Various 2D and 3D games <br>
          Games and apps created as learning experiences. In all of the I have created the textures,3D models,2D models,
          the code and the sounds. Examples can be provided upon request.</li>
        <br>

        <li>CRUD Web app <br>
          A Create Read Update Delete (CRUD) application made for a Databases Course in my University.

            <li>All Transcactions between store and customers</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        The application was made using
